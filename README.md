# Galaxies-reseaech-based-on-EAGLE-simulation
The project started on July.2018. The purpose is to learn the data(Galaxies Formation) from EAGLE simulation and compare the result with the observation. 
Based on observation, there exists a MS (StellarMass vs SFR) of galaxies. The first step is to find the MS at different z so that we can devide the active galaxies(we define these step) into the two parts: galaxies above the MS and below the MS, which is the preparation for our next step.
